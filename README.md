## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a mundane object in the house (a spoon, a tile, a window latch) 'remembers' and reveals a hidden history to Amaya during the inventory.
- Compose the 17th-century court poet's treatise on jasmine that Arjun is translating, blending horticulture with veiled political allegory.
- Write a 'ghost ledger' entry from the perspective of the house itself, cataloging the emotions and events imprinted on its walls, counter to Carrington's official inventory.
- Draft a mythic origin story for the 'hum in the soil' that Amaya dreams of, connecting it to a local legend of a buried guardian or a silenced protest.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive 'Mythic Map' of Villa Jasmin's grounds, where users can click on features (the walled garden, the old stone basin, the frangipani tree) to reveal layered narratives: Carrington's clinical description, Amaya's sensory memory, and the land's mythic recollection.
- Create a 'Clause Generator' that produces procedurally generated, legalese 'Annexures' from the fictional Independence Accord, each describing a new way to legally dispossess, which can be used as writing prompts for additional scenes of bureaucratic encroachment.
